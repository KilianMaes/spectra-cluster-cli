# spectra-cluster-cli
Prototype of a CLI to run the clustering process

Currently, two branches exist:
* master: Clustering based on major peaks. One output file created per major peak (data is duplicated)
* precursor_bins: Currently, the __latest version__. Bins spectra based on precursor m/z and then does the clustering.
